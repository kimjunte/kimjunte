## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

If your from my youtube channel, my automations scripts that are most commonly used are under my pinned section.

If your a hiring manager/recruiter, most of repos are private under 'MealCraft' due to running a self-hosted runner. I have some public repo that don't need a self hosted runner but feel free to check it out here [MealCraft Github](https://github.com/orgs/MealCraft/repositories?q=visibility%3Apublic+archived%3Afalse)
